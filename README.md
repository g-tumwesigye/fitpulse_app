# FitPulse App

FitPulse App predicts Body Fat Percentage using a trained Linear regression model. This App helps users track their fitness levels by providing predictions based on their personal details such as weight, height, age, BMI, and gender. The application is built using Flutter for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, integrating machine learning for the prediction.

## 1. Introduction

The **FitPulse App** is a mobile application designed to predict Body Fat Percentage (BFP) based on various factors like weight, height, BMI, age, and gender. The model is trained using a dataset and implemented through machine learning techniques using  linear regression). The app interacts with an API built using FastAPI, which serves the trained model for prediction requests.

### Problem Statement:
Track and predict the body fat percentage for individuals based on their personal information. This can help users better understand their health and make informed decisions on how to improve.

uvicorn main:app --reload

Frontend Set Up (Flutter App)
1. Install Flutter SDK

2. Run the Flutter app:
flutter run ```````

Model Training
The model is trained on the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafa20635/fitness-exercises-using-bfp-and-bmi) using Linear Regression to predict Body Fat Percentage based on the user's weight, height, BMI, Gender, and age.

Usage
Input data (weight, height, BMI, age, gender) in the Flutter app.
Get the predicted Body Fat Percentage from the FastAPI backend.
